# Prototypes in Javascript

This browser-based [presentation](http://jcamenisch.github.com/prototypes-in-javascript/)
walks through prototypal inheritance in Javascript, first with old-fashioned constructor 
syntax, then with ECMAScript 5's much nicer Object.create() syntax, and then with a 
custom-brewed syntax for more convenience (and as an educational exercise).

I presented this at an [OKC.js](http://okcjs.com/) meetup on November 27, 2012.
If you're interested, check out the
[screencast](http://s3.camenischcreative.com/screencasts/JS-Prototypes-Talk.mov),
featuring a related presentation by [Dennis Ferron](https://github.com/dennisferron)
on the history of prototype-based languages.

The behavior of the slides is custom-coded as an exercise in using the techniques
described in the presentation. See the [source/javascripts/slide_show.js](source/javascripts/slide_show.js)
file for the fun parts.
